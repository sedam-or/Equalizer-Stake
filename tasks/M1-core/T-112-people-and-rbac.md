## Goal
Admins manage people, roles and guardian links. Every list or detail read is scoped to what the actor may see, and PII is decrypted only for permitted roles, with an audit trail.

## Context
- IDN-10 scopes. A `Scope` is computed from the `Actor`:
  - `All` (owner, admin)
  - `Instructor(pid)`: people who participate in sessions they teach. **Until scheduling exists (M2), Instructor scope = self only.** Leave a `// TODO(T-2xx)` with the hook `ScopeResolver` port, which scheduling registers later.
  - `Guardian(pid)`: self plus linked students.
  - `Self_(pid)`
- Scoping happens in SQL (`WHERE id = ANY($visible_ids)` or a join on `person_links`), never by filtering in Rust after loading.
- API (all under `/api/v1`):

| Method | Path | Perm | Body → Result | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/people` | identity.people.read | `?role=&q=&status=&limit=&cursor=&sort=display_name\|-created_at` → `{items: [PersonSummary], next_cursor}` | |
| POST | `/people` | identity.people.write | `{display_name, legal_name?, email?, phone?, birth_date?, roles: [Role], invite: bool, guardian_of?: [uuid], guardians?: [{guardian_id, relationship?, is_primary}]}` → Person (201) | 409 `email_taken` |
| GET | `/people/{id}` | identity.people.read | Person (PII fields null unless `identity.people.read_pii` and in scope) | 404 if out of scope |
| PATCH | `/people/{id}` | identity.people.write | partial Person, `If-Match` | 409 `version_conflict`, 428 |
| POST | `/people/{id}/invite` | identity.people.write | `{role, channel: email\|whatsapp\|link}` → `{invite_url?}` | |
| POST | `/people/{id}/roles` | identity.roles.write | `{role}` → 204 | 403 if admin grants owner/admin |
| DELETE | `/people/{id}/roles/{role}` | identity.roles.write | → 204 | 409 `last_owner` |
| POST | `/people/{id}/deactivate`, `/reactivate` | identity.people.write | → 204 | 409 `last_owner` |
| POST | `/people/{id}/links` | identity.people.write | `{student_id, relationship?, is_primary}` → 204 (id is the guardian) | 409 `primary_exists` |
| DELETE | `/people/{id}/links/{student_id}` | identity.people.write | → 204 | |

- `PersonSummary {id, display_name, roles, status, avatar_url?}`. `Person = PersonSummary + {legal_name?, email?, phone?, birth_date?, locale?, guardians: [{id, display_name, relationship, is_primary}], students: [{id, display_name}], version}`.
- Rules:
  1. Only an owner may grant or revoke the `owner` or `admin` roles (`identity.admins.manage`). An admin calling it → 403 `forbidden {perm: identity.admins.manage}`.
  2. Removing `owner` from, or deactivating, the last active owner → 409 `last_owner`.
  3. A student has at most one primary guardian (DB unique index). Violation → 409 `primary_exists`.
  4. A guardian link requires the guardian to have the `guardian` role and the student the `student` role → 422 `validation`.
  5. Email uniqueness per tenant via `email_bidx` (unique index) → 409 `email_taken`.
  6. Deactivate: all memberships of the person → `deactivated`, then `AuthService::revoke_all`.
  7. PII read audit (AUD-01): when an actor reads **another** person's decrypted PII, write audit `identity.person.pii_read` (category compliance), throttled to one per (actor, subject, local day) through `INSERT … WHERE NOT EXISTS` on the audit table for that day.
- `q` search uses `display_name ILIKE` with `pg_trgm` similarity ordering. Email search: if `q` contains `@`, look up by `bidx_email(q)` exactly.
- Cursor: base64url JSON `{k: sort_key, id}` (API-05); max limit 200, default 50.
- Every mutation: audit (`identity.person.created|updated|deactivated|reactivated`, `identity.role.granted|revoked`, `identity.link.created|deleted`) with `Auditable` snapshots that **exclude** PII (`#[audit(skip)]` on encrypted fields).

- **Alignment with spec 20–24** (added with the canonical-behaviour specs):
  - Request DTOs use T-102a field kinds per VAL-25 §5.2 (`DisplayName`, `LegalName`, `Email`, `Phone`, `BirthDate`, `Address`, `ShortText`) and reject unknown fields; tests per VAL-51 (unknown field, mass assignment, all errors together).
  - Membership and link transitions follow STM-20/27, including 409 `last_owner` and 409 `primary_exists`. Unlinking the last guardian of a minor with an active enrollment (409 `guardian_required`, D-41) applies once enrollment exists (M4) — not in this task.
- Permission ≠ scope (AUTH-04): the permission decides the action, the SQL scope (`All`/`Instructor`/`Guardian`/`Self_`) decides the rows; out-of-scope ids return 404, a missing permission 403 (spec 25 §7, ADR-0017).

## Scope
### In
- The endpoints, services, repos, the `Scope` type and the `ScopeResolver` port in `eq_core::ports`.

### Out
- Avatar upload (files are M3/T-303). Bulk import (M4).

## Acceptance criteria
- AC1. A guardian with 2 linked students calling `GET /people?role=student` gets exactly those 2. → `api_people::guardian_scope`
- AC2. A student calling `GET /people/{other}` → 404. → `student_cannot_see_others`
- AC3. Removing owner from the only owner → 409 `last_owner`. → `last_owner_protected`
- AC4. An admin granting `admin` → 403. The owner can. → `admin_cannot_grant_admin`
- AC5. A second primary guardian → 409 `primary_exists`. → `one_primary_guardian_api`
- AC6. An admin reading another person's PII twice in a day → exactly one `identity.person.pii_read` audit row. → `pii_read_audited_once_per_day`
- AC7. A duplicate email (case and whitespace different) → 409 `email_taken`. → `email_taken_normalized`
- AC8. Deactivate → the person's refresh token no longer refreshes (401). → `deactivate_revokes_sessions`
- AC9. Pagination over 120 people with limit 50 returns 50/50/20 with no duplicates. → `cursor_pagination`

## Tests to write
| File | Test names |
|---|---|
| `crates/eq-identity/tests/api_people.rs` | AC names above, plus the permission matrix test `people_endpoints_role_matrix` (every endpoint × allowed and forbidden role, per TST-04) |

## Definition of done
- [ ] Code quality and architecture: `spec/16-code-quality.md` §12 and `spec/17-clean-architecture.md` followed (decisions in `domain/`, own tables only, no new `#[allow]`); `check-layers.sh` and `check-web-boundaries.sh` pass once T-006 has created them
- [ ] Rust checks pass; `make api` regenerated
- [ ] Commit `feat(identity): people, roles and guardian links [T-112]`, signed off
