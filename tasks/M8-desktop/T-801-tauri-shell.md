title: Add the Tauri 2 desktop app that runs the server in-process and opens the setup wizard
milestone: M8
status: draft
depends_on: [T-711]
spec_refs: [DST-20, DST-02]
estimated_size: M
---

> **Draft.** This task is complete in intent but cites spec sections instead of inlining them. Before it moves to `todo`, the maintainer (or the spec author) inlines the cited DDL, structs and rules, re-checks it against what M1–M3 actually shipped, and removes this note. Codex must not start a `draft` task.

## Goal
A school with one front-desk PC installs an app and is at the setup wizard without a terminal.

## Context
- DST-20 in `spec/14-distribution.md` §5: `apps/desktop`, `eq_server::run(config)` on a tokio runtime (no sidecar), native window to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/setup?token=…`.

## Scope
### In
- `apps/desktop` Tauri project, `eq_server::run` library entry (refactor `serve` to call it)

### Out
- Embedded Postgres (T-802)

## Files
| Path | Action | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/desktop/tests` | create or modify | Path named in this task's contract. |

## Interfaces
Use only the exact domain signatures, DTOs, SQL DDL, endpoints and wire values stated in this task's Context and Scope. Do not add a public contract.

## Business rules
Apply only the policy keys, defaults, ranges and state transitions stated in this task's inline contract. If a value is absent, do not infer one.

## Security
- Triggers: T4 (SBD-30).
- Data classes touched: S3 per ERD-04/ERD-05; do not create a data class outside `spec/29-erd.md` §5.
- I: S2/S3 disclosure or secret leakage → encrypt/hash as specified, require `read_pii` for sensitive reads, and never log personal data or secret values (SBD-10/21/23, SEC-02/03/21).
- Abuse-case acceptance criterion: `smoke` must exercise the task's highest-risk forbidden, replay or cross-tenant path and demonstrate rejection without its control (SBD-31/73).

## Implementation notes
Follow the ordered behavior already stated in Context, Scope and Acceptance criteria; keep the task's listed test names unchanged.

## Acceptance criteria
- AC1. App starts against an external dev DB and shows the wizard (manual + WebDriver smoke) → `desktop::smoke`

## Tests to write
| File | Test names |
|---|---|
| `apps/desktop/tests` | smoke |

## Definition of done
- [ ] Code quality and architecture: `spec/16-code-quality.md` §12 and `spec/17-clean-architecture.md` followed (decisions in `domain/`, own tables only, no new `#[allow]`); `check-layers.sh` and `check-web-boundaries.sh` pass once T-006 has created them
- [ ] All checks for the touched stacks pass (Rust and/or web), guard scripts pass, `make api` regenerated if the API changed
- [ ] `scripts/check-literals.sh` passes: every business value comes from the module policy
- [ ] Commit `feat(desktop): Tauri shell [T-801]`, signed off

## Report

**Deviations** — RATIFY: TD-067, required task-template headings filled from existing task text only.
**Security deviation** — RATIFY: TD-066, SBD-30 trigger classification and corresponding spec-backed Security section.

## Questions


- **Self-resolved (implementer, run 6; TD-067):** required template sections were missing → complete them only from the existing task contract, Scope and tests without inventing behavior.
- **Self-resolved (implementer, run 6; TD-066):** classify SBD-30 triggers from the task behavior and add the corresponding spec-backed Security section; use `No triggers.` for a reviewed false positive.

## Review
n/a — pending review after implementation.
