id: T-604
title: Add rental jobs (hold expiry, auto-complete) and payment confirmation on invoice paid
milestone: M6
status: todo
depends_on: [T-603]
spec_refs: [RNT-06, RNT-07, RNT-09, TST-15]
estimated_size: S

> **Draft.** This task is complete in intent but cites spec sections instead of inlining them. Before it moves to `todo`, the maintainer (or the spec author) inlines the cited DDL, structs and rules, re-checks it against what M1–M3 actually shipped, and removes this note. Codex must not start a `draft` task.

## Goal
Unpaid holds free the room on time, and paid reservations confirm themselves.

## Context
- RNT-06 consumer of `billing.invoice_paid.v1` for invoices linked to a reservation; RNT-07 expiry every minute (module AC2); RNT-09 auto-complete.

## Scope
### In
- Two jobs, one consumer

### Out
- —

## Files
| Path | Action | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/eq-rental/tests/jobs.rs` | test | Task-listed verification file. |

## Interfaces
Use only the exact domain signatures, DTOs, SQL DDL, endpoints and wire values stated in this task's Context and Scope. Do not add a public contract.

## Business rules
Apply only the policy keys, defaults, ranges and state transitions stated in this task's inline contract. If a value is absent, do not infer one.

## Security
- Triggers: T7 (SBD-30).
- Data classes touched: S1 per ERD-04/ERD-05; do not create a data class outside `spec/29-erd.md` §5.
- T/R: duplicate or unauthorized state transitions → use transactional state checks, idempotency/If-Match where specified, and audit committed mutations (SBD-53/57, STM rules in the task).
- Abuse-case acceptance criterion: `hold_expiry` must exercise the task's highest-risk forbidden, replay or cross-tenant path and demonstrate rejection without its control (SBD-31/73).

## Implementation notes
Follow the ordered behavior already stated in Context, Scope and Acceptance criteria; keep the task's listed test names unchanged.

## Acceptance criteria
- AC1. AC2 hold expiry releases holds → `jobs::hold_expiry`
- AC2. Paid → confirmed → `paid_confirms`

## Tests to write
| File | Test names |
|---|---|
| `crates/eq-rental/tests/jobs.rs` | AC names |

## Definition of done
- [ ] Code quality and architecture: `spec/16-code-quality.md` §12 and `spec/17-clean-architecture.md` followed (decisions in `domain/`, own tables only, no new `#[allow]`); `check-layers.sh` and `check-web-boundaries.sh` pass once T-006 has created them
- [ ] All checks for the touched stacks pass (Rust and/or web), guard scripts pass, `make api` regenerated if the API changed
- [ ] `scripts/check-literals.sh` passes: every business value comes from the module policy
- [ ] Commit `feat(rental): expiry and confirmation [T-604]`, signed off

## Report

**Deviations** — RATIFY: TD-067, required task-template headings filled from existing task text only.
**Security deviation** — RATIFY: TD-066, SBD-30 trigger classification and corresponding spec-backed Security section.

## Questions


- **Self-resolved (implementer, run 6; TD-067):** required template sections were missing → complete them only from the existing task contract, Scope and tests without inventing behavior.
- **Self-resolved (implementer, run 6; TD-066):** classify SBD-30 triggers from the task behavior and add the corresponding spec-backed Security section; use `No triggers.` for a reviewed false positive.

## Review
n/a — pending review after implementation.
